## Try it:
+ Computes the average of three predefined exam grades:
  - Bnagla-84
  - English-87
  - Math-92 
  and prints the average twice.
+ Improve the program:
  - to read the three grades from input and 
  - print the average first as a float and 
  - then as an integer,
    using:
    * explicit type conversation. 
    * Ignore any differences that occur due to rounding.
